We would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to review this report. Our goal is to answer some important questions which will faciliate your investment decision. The question are:
* What is the population of Des Moines? 
* How does its population compare to the population of New York City? 
* Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program? 
### Analysis 
According to the US census beaureau[2], Des Moines population as at July 1, 2019 was  214,237. Slide 1 of the [Story point](https://public.tableau.com/profile/femi.adeleke#!/vizhome/Book1_15955256267580/StoryPoints?publish=yes) shows a breakdown of the population by age.

### Comparison with New York City
In comparison to New York City with a population of 1,628,706, Des Moines forms only 13% of Manhattan NY City's population. However,as shown on slides 4 and 5 of the [story point](https://public.tableau.com/profile/femi.adeleke#!/vizhome/Book1_15955256267580/StoryPoints?publish=yes), a significant increase in population was observed in the metro area of Des Moines city.

This gives us the confidence that a bike sharing program in Des Moines would be well patronized. Furthermore, the second slide of the [story point](https://public.tableau.com/profile/femi.adeleke#!/vizhome/Book1_15955256267580/StoryPoints?publish=yes) shows that the white population in Manhattan New York are more than those of other descent and they most likely form the majority of those currently patronizing the bike sharing program in New york.A similar trend was also observed in the population of Des Moines. The white group represents the majority and would most likely patronize the bike sharing program a lot more in Des moines. 
In addition, looking at the income & poverty level of New Yorks population as shown on slide 3 of the [story point](https://public.tableau.com/profile/femi.adeleke#!/vizhome/Book1_15955256267580/StoryPoints?publish=yes), the per capital income of Manhattan New Yorks population as at December 2018 was $72,832 while that of Des Moines population was $27,325 also, the
